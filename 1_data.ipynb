    "\n",
    "As with any machine learning task, the best place to start is by inspecting the data available, and for this competition, we are spoiled for choice! In total, 600 GB of (mostly compressed) training data is available for you to use and experiment with, including 73 GB of [HRV satellite imagery](https://huggingface.co/datasets/climatehackai/climatehackai-2023/tree/main/satellite-hrv), 189 GB of [non-HRV satellite imagery](https://huggingface.co/datasets/climatehackai/climatehackai-2023/tree/main/satellite-nonhrv), 78 GB of [weather forecasts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/climatehackai/climatehackai-2023/tree/main/weather), 259 GB of [air quality forecasts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/climatehackai/climatehackai-2023/tree/main/aerosols) and ~1 GB of [historical solar PV generation data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/climatehackai/climatehackai-2023/tree/main/pv).\n",

Having said that, it is up to you to **be creative** to decide which data sources you actually do want to use and train on! Ultimately, you want to build an **accurate and performant machine learning model** capable of extracting as much useful information from the available data as possible in order to maximally explain any variance in solar PV yields.\n",

This means that you do not in theory have to load all of the data you wish to use into memory at once.\n",
